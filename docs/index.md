# talkarr

Talkarr is a *arr like program that allows you to download and manage videos from media.ccc.de.

The idea was to create a program to download the favorites from the [**Fahrplan app**](https://github.com/EventFahrplan/EventFahrplan) to be able to watch them at home, for example when you were not able to be at the event.

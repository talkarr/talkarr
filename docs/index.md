# Talkarr

Talkarr is a *arr like program that allows you to download and manage videos from media.ccc.de.

The idea was to create a program to download the favorites from [**EventFahrplan**](https://github.com/EventFahrplan/EventFahrplan) to be able to watch them at home, for example when you were not able to be at the event.

## Features

- Search for talks by title, description, speaker, and more
- Import favorites from EventFahrplan via the JSON sharing
- NFO files ready for Jellyfin and co

And many more features to come in future releases!
